The MATLAB script in this repository was used to calculate the junction temperature of several different LEDs by fitting the energy obtained from the spectra to a Boltzmann distribution. From this fit, the temperature was extracted.

The spectral data that was obtained in lab is included in the CSV files. It was discovered that there is a 15nm calibration needed for the equipment that was used, which is taken care of in the script.
